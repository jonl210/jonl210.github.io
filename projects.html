      <h2>Scrum Project</h2>
      <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
      <p>
        The Scrum project so far has completed work on the initial home page of
        the site, as well as the navigation bar. The navigation bar includes
        links to Log in and Sign up pages, as well as a link to a shopping cart
        page. I have contributed implementing the home page, navigation bar and
        log in page.
      </p>
      <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
      <p>This sprint we have completed the item form, as well as different log in screens for customers and employees. I contributed redesigning the approach for choosing to log in as a customer or employee.</p>
      <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
      <p>This sprint I completed the item page. This page displays a specific item based on the given id. I made the items name a link, so clicking on it will take you to that specific item. Some dummy data was added to the database to make testing and designing easier.</p>
      <h3>Sprint 4</h3>
      <p>This sprint I was the product owner. I ensured that each team member had a task to complete, and I personally provided descriptions for every task. I also provided clarification and feeback as team members completed their tasks. I also solved 2 database issues during the sprint as well. I reviewed every task and ensured that everyone could see their task to completion.</p>
