      <h2>Scrum Project</h2>
      <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
      <p>
        The Scrum project so far has completed work on the initial home page of
        the site, as well as the navigation bar. The navigation bar includes
        links to Log in and Sign up pages, as well as a link to a shopping cart
        page. I have contributed implementing the home page, navigation bar and
        log in page.
      </p>
      <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
      <p>This sprint we have completed the item form, as well as different log in screens for customers and employees. I contributed redesigning the approach for choosing to log in as a customer or employee.</p>
